042_how_to_connect_your_local_repository_to_remote_repository

Create a local repository
Create a remote repository on the Github
Let's connect them, and let's see what internally happens

Let's also see what internally happens when you perform "push"

======================================================================
# Create local repository named repo
git init repo

cd repo

======================================================================
vim f1.txt
a

git add f1.txt

git commit -m "1"

======================================================================
Create a remote repository named repo on Github

Copy SSH address of your remote repository

======================================================================
# remote has functionalities related to remote repository
# add: connects remote repository to local repository
# origin: name of remote repository you will use
git remote add origin ssh_address_of_remote-repository

======================================================================
go to gistory

</xmp><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youngminpark2559/vcs/master/eg/pics/2019_02_28_08:59:01.png"><xmp>

data about remote named "origin" is stored in ./.git/config
address of "origin" is stored in url
when you bring data, where will you bring data from your remote repository, 
and where will you store that data to in your local repository

======================================================================
# Check current branch
git branch
* master

# Let's try to push "tasks" you did in the local repository into the remote repository
git push
</xmp><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youngminpark2559/vcs/master/eg/pics/2019_02_28_09:02:35.png"><xmp>

# Meaning: current branch named "master" has no upstream branch,
# so you need to run
# origin: repository
# master: branch
git push --set-upstream origin master

upstream: can be considered as remote repository which is connected to local repository

======================================================================
</xmp><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youngminpark2559/vcs/master/eg/pics/2019_02_28_09:05:47.png"><xmp>

Above command does 2 following:
1. master branch of local repository is connected to master branch of remote repository
1. upload codes

======================================================================
./.git/config file has been changed
</xmp><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youngminpark2559/vcs/master/eg/pics/2019_02_28_09:07:17.png"><xmp>

branch called "master" is newly stored.

======================================================================
refs/remotes/origin/master file has been created

</xmp><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youngminpark2559/vcs/master/eg/pics/2019_02_28_09:09:31.png"><xmp>

======================================================================
refs/heads/master contains information of master branch of local repository

======================================================================
Commit which is pointed by refs/heads/master file
</xmp><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youngminpark2559/vcs/master/eg/pics/2019_02_28_09:10:44.png"><xmp>

======================================================================
# --decorate: to see detailed infomation
# --graph: to see information in illustration
git log --decorate --graph

</xmp><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youngminpark2559/vcs/master/eg/pics/2019_02_28_09:12:25.png"><xmp>

"Current branch master in local repository"
and "master branch in remote repository" which is connected to local master branch
are pointing to same commit 

======================================================================
vim f1.txt
a
b

git commit -am 2

vim f1.txt
a
b
c

git commit -am 3

======================================================================
git log --decorate --graph

</xmp><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youngminpark2559/vcs/master/eg/pics/2019_02_28_09:15:00.png"><xmp>

In local repository had performed "2 number of commits"

Since you're before "push", origin/master branch has still "1 commit"

How about infomation can be told to you?

It's because git stores relevant data

======================================================================
commit which is pointed by ./.git/refs/heads/master file
</xmp><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youngminpark2559/vcs/master/eg/pics/2019_02_28_09:16:44.png"><xmp>

commit which is pointed by ./.git/refs/remotes/origin/master file
</xmp><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youngminpark2559/vcs/master/eg/pics/2019_02_28_09:17:31.png"><xmp>

======================================================================
git push

you will not see "you should perform set stream command"
because you connected 2 branches of local and remote repositories

</xmp><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youngminpark2559/vcs/master/eg/pics/2019_02_28_09:19:28.png"><xmp>

======================================================================
Commit which is pointed by ./.git/refs/remotes/origin/master file
</xmp><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youngminpark2559/vcs/master/eg/pics/2019_02_28_09:20:03.png"><xmp>

======================================================================
git log --decorate --graph

</xmp><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youngminpark2559/vcs/master/eg/pics/2019_02_28_09:20:41.png"><xmp>
